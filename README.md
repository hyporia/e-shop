# e-shop

## Overview

This project is an e-commerce platform where users can buy and sell products. The system is built using microservices architecture, with each service responsible for specific tasks. Message queues are used to decouple these services, ensuring scalability and reliability.

**Note:** This project was created for educational purposes.
